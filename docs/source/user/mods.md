# Additional Mods

Bigger Industrialisation has a flexible system for supporting *additional mods*; that is, mods that
may or may not be included by default, but are integrated with recipe tweaks.

All mods in this table may be added or removed before creating your world. Support is provided for
any configuration of these installed mods.

```{warning}
If a *content* mod is not listed in this table, it is considered a "core mod" and must not be
uninstalled. Mods that don't add any in-game content and are not library dependencies aren't
listed here.

Removing one of these mods voids any support you might get.
