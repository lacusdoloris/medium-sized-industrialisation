				"The &aPyrolyse Oven&r is a multipurpose multiblock that primarily deals with burning biological material into various fluids. It's like an EBF leaned on its side, including the usage of tiered coils. Sadly, &dcupronickel coils&r confer a &dspeed penalty&r; you should consider going through the bauxite processing questtline to get aluminium for &dFerrochrolumium&r coils."

				"If you're running off of boilers, you should consider replacing your coke ovens (you're using coke ovens... right?) with one of these."
				""
				"It's up to you what byproducts you refine from your charcoal, but here's a quick guide to each:"
				""
				"- &bWood Tar&r distills primarily into burnable products. This is good for getting more energy out of your wood."
				"- &bWood Vinegar&r's best byproducts are methanol and acetic acid, both useful for petrochemical production."
				"- &bWood Gas&r distills into carbon gasses and methane; alternatively, it can be burnt directly for energy."
				"- &bCoal Tar&r's is useful for hydrogen sulfide production."
				"- &bCoal Gas&r is an easy source for ammonia and ethylbenzene."
				"- &bCharcoal Byproducts&r distills into various other wood chemicals less efficiently than just burning the wood."
				"- &bHeavy Oil&r can be produced for a renewable alternative to fluid drilling rigs."
				"- &bCreosote&r is used to make minecart rails or as an extremely easy source of lubricant."
				"- &bBiomass&r can be turned straight into ethanol, which is then useful for ethylene production."
				""
				"If you're having trouble deciding, &dwood vinegar&r for methanol will assist you in getting silicone rubber which is required for HV and further. Setting up biomass production from bio chaff is also a low effort mechanism for ethylene production."
